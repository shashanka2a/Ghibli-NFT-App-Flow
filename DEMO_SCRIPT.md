## 🎯 **MINUTE 1: Introduction & GitHub Overview** (0:00-1:00)

### Opening Hook (0:00-0:15)
> "Hi everyone! I'm excited to show you **Mintari** - but this isn't just another NFT platform. While building Mintari's reward system, I realized we could solve a bigger problem: every Flow project rebuilds rewards from scratch. So I'm also introducing **AfterMint SDK** - a public reward system for the entire Flow ecosystem."

### GitHub Repository Tour (0:15-1:00)
**[Switch to GitHub]**

> "Let's start with our GitHub repository. Mintari is built with cutting-edge tech:"

**Point to key features:**
- 🎨 "**Mintari**: Complete Ghibli NFT creator - our showcase application"
- 🔧 "**AfterMint SDK**: The real innovation - reward system for any Flow project"
- ⛓️ "**Flow integration**: Real blockchain minting with FCL"
- 🌐 "**Multi-provider IPFS**: Walrus, Pinata, Web3.Storage for reliability"
- 💰 "**Ecosystem partnerships**: POAP, NBA Top Shot, Pinnacle integrations"

**Scroll to SDK vision:**
> "Here's the key insight: instead of every project building rewards separately, AfterMint SDK makes it one-line integration. Due to hackathon time constraints, I focused on perfecting the logic in Mintari, but the SDK architecture is designed and ready for deployment."

**Scroll to architecture diagram:**
> "Our architecture is designed for scalability - frontend talks to AI services, uploads to decentralized IPFS, and mints real NFTs on Flow blockchain."

## 🚀 **MINUTE 2: Live Demo - Core Flow** (1:00-2:00)

### App Launch (1:00-1:10)

**Click "Get Started"**

### Wallet Connection (1:10-1:25)
> "First, we connect our Flow wallet. Mintari supports all major Flow wallets - Blocto, Lilico, Flow Wallet, and more."

**[Connect wallet - show the process]**
- Click "Connect Flow Wallet"
- Select wallet from FCL discovery
- Authenticate

> "Notice how smooth this is - we're using Flow's FCL library for seamless wallet integration."

### Image Upload & Transformation (1:25-2:00)
**[Upload demo image]**

> "Now I'll upload an image. Watch the magic happen!"

**[Show upload process]**
- Drag and drop image
- Show loading animation
- **[Point to console]** "In the console, you can see our AI transformation pipeline working"

> "Our system tries multiple AI providers - Replicate first, then Hugging Face, with beautiful fallbacks. The result? A stunning Ghibli-style transformation!"

---

## 🎨 **MINUTE 3: Advanced Features Demo** (2:00-3:00)

### IPFS Upload & Metadata (2:00-2:20)
**[Show transformation result]**

> "Beautiful! Now watch as we upload this to IPFS for decentralized storage."

**Click "Confirm Mint"**
**[Fill metadata form quickly]**
- Name: "My Ghibli Moment"
- Description: "AI-transformed magical art"
- Creator: "Demo User"

**Click "Mint NFT"**

> "Behind the scenes, we're uploading to multiple IPFS providers for maximum reliability. **[Point to console]** You can see it trying Walrus first, then Pinata as backup."

### Real Blockchain Transaction (2:20-2:45)
**[Show minting progress]**

> "Now we're creating a REAL transaction on Flow blockchain. This isn't a demo - we're actually minting an NFT!"

**[Point to console logs]**
> "Look at these console logs - real transaction IDs, real blockchain interaction. This will be viewable on FlowScan!"

### Success & Rewards (2:45-3:00)
**[Success screen appears]**

> "Success! Here's our beautiful success screen with the minted NFT. But here's where AfterMint SDK shines!"

**[Sponsor popup appears or click "Flow Offers"]**

> "This reward system took weeks to build for Mintari. But imagine if any Flow project could integrate this with just one line of code! That's the AfterMint SDK vision - POAP, NBA Top Shot, Pinnacle partnerships available to the entire ecosystem."

---

## 🚀 **MINUTE 4: Technical Deep Dive & Future** (3:00-4:00)

### Technical Highlights (3:00-3:30)
**[Switch between console and FlowScan]**

> "Let's talk technical excellence:"

**[Show console logs]**
- "**Multi-provider fallbacks** - if Walrus fails, we try Pinata, Web3.Storage, even base64 fallback"
- "**Real Flow transactions** - this NFT is now on Flow testnet"
- "**Type-safe development** - full TypeScript coverage"
- "**Professional analytics** - we track sponsor engagement like Rokt"

**[Open FlowScan if transaction is ready]**
> "Here's our transaction on FlowScan - real blockchain proof!"

### Deployment & Scalability (3:30-3:45)
> "Deployment is production-ready:"
- "**Vercel-optimized** with automatic deployments"
- "**Docker containerized** for any cloud provider"
- "**Environment-based configuration** for easy scaling"
- "**Multiple IPFS providers** ensure 99.9% uptime"

### Future Roadmap (3:45-4:00)
> "Here's my post-hackathon roadmap:"
- "**AfterMint SDK deployment** - publish as public npm package"
- "**Flow ecosystem adoption** - onboard 10+ projects in Q1"
- "**Mintari mainnet launch** - showcase the SDK's power"
- "**Developer documentation** - make integration effortless"
- "**Enterprise partnerships** - white-label SDK solutions"

### Closing (3:55-4:00)
> "This hackathon taught me something important: the best solutions solve problems for entire ecosystems, not just individual projects. Mintari proves the concept works beautifully, but AfterMint SDK will empower every Flow project to create engaging post-mint experiences."

> "I built the logic, designed the architecture, and proved it works. Now I'm ready to make it available to everyone. Thank you!"
